# CV_garbage_classification
Computer vision (CV) project (machine learning) for garbage classification.
The Garbage Classification Dataset contains 6 classifications: cardboard (393), glass (491), metal (400), paper(584), plastic (472) and trash(127).
I used PyTorch module for solving this problem. I got pretrained ResNet50 model from that module and train it on my task with using transfer learning.
